                <p>We offer a minimum stay of 2 nights, carefully designed for you to enjoy an authentic ayahuasca ceremony in a safe and comfortable environment. From the moment you arrive in Iquitos, we take care of everything : we pick you up from your hotel, bring you to our lodge, and provide you with healthy and delicious meals adapted to the ayahuasca diet.</p>
                <p>The ayahuasca ceremony is held in a traditional maloka, a rustic and protected space, just a short walk from your bungalow. Guided by an indigenous shaman, you will embark on a deep journey of self-discovery and healing, followed by a flower bath to balance your body, mind, and spirit. The next morning, the shaman will help you interpret your visions, offering clarity and understanding.</p>
                <p>We are committed to using the highest quality ayahuasca, harvested and prepared according to indigenous traditions, to ensure a pure and transformative experience. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity! to learn more and secure your place in this unforgettable experience.</p>
